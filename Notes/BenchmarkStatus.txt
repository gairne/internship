dmm:

Multiply two arrays and add all elements together
Repa and DPH working

mst:

Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm.
DPH only. Segmentation faults

NBody:

Barnes-Hut algorithm.
Inefficient according to http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/DataParallel/BenchmarkStatus
DPH version works. Repa version implemented using Lazy Tree Splitting.
Lacking a filter and (nested) list comprehension parallelism.

nqueens:

Nqueens problem.
DPH version works but with newest versions of dph.
No repa version because the algorithm is heavy on the nested list comprehension

quickhull:

Hull Convex, a divide and conquer algorithm.
DPH works. Repa works but requires a nested scheduler of kinds.
The Repa version works with the monad-par Repa scheduler. Current plans are to port it to lazy tree splitting.

quicksort:

Divide and Conquer sorting
DPH occassionally (more often then not) gets index out of bounds exceptions

smvm

Sparse Matrix multiplication with a vector
Currently not working because of type failures.

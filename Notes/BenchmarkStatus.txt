dmm:

Multiply two arrays and add all elements together
Repa and DPH working

mst:

Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm.
DPH only. Segmentation faults

NBody:

Barnes-Hut algorithm.
DPH version works. Repa version partly implemented.
Lacking a filter and (nested) list comprehension parallelism.

nqueens:

Nqueens problem.
DPH version works but with newest versions of dph.
No repa version because the algorithm is heavy on the nested list comprehension

quickhull:

Hull Convex, a divide and conquer algorithm.
DPH works. Repa is partly implemented but requires nested parallelism

quicksort:

Divide and Conquer sorting
DPH occassionally (more often then not) gets index out of bounds exceptions

smvm

Sparse Matrix multiplication with a vector
Currently not working because of type failures.

crossMapP: not implemented
(Using version 0.6.1.2 but it appears in 0.7.0.1)

This error appears in .../Lifted/Combinators.hs in crossMapPP

crossMapPP is the lifted version of crossMapP

find . -name "*" -exec grep -H "crossMapP" \{\} \; ;
./Array/Parallel.hs:        , crossMapP
./Array/Parallel.hs:crossMapP :: [:a:] -> (a -> [:b:]) -> [:(a, b):]
./Array/Parallel.hs:{-# NOINLINE crossMapP #-}
./Array/Parallel.hs:crossMapP !_ !_ = emptyP

The fix is to use a later version of DPH where crossMapP is implemented.
